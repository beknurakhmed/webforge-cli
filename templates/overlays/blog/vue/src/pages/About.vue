      <p>Hi! I'm Jane, a passionate developer with over 8 years of experience building web applications. I write about React, TypeScript, Node.js, and modern web development practices.</p>
      <br />
      <p>When I'm not coding, you can find me contributing to open-source projects, mentoring junior developers, or exploring new technologies. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and sharing knowledge with the community.</p>
      <br />
      <p>This blog is my space to share tutorials, best practices, and insights from real-world projects. Feel free to reach out if you have questions or want to collaborate!</p>
